# Summative Website by Josh Day

This is my Summative website assignment. I have created a website that provides the latest information in the North East region of the United Kingdom.

The main page of the website is the index.html file.

The graphs are created using google charts (https://developers.google.com/chart) and all other information sourced from external websites is referenced appropriately on each page.

The logo for the website was created by me and the image of the North East region was sourced from Wikipedia.

The website was made using HTML/CSS, using the web framework Bootstrap and the graphs are made using javascript.

Since each page uses the same javascript code with diffrent data, there is one JSDoc for all the JS files. Each JS file has also been run through ESLint.
